**Water Quality Analysis**
Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings.
From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights.
Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.
So if you want to learn how to do water quality analysis with machine learning, this article is for you.
In this article, I will walk you through water quality analysis with Machine Learning using Python.

One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the analysis of water quality.
It is also known as water potability analysis because our task here is to understand all the 
factors that affect water potability and train a machine learning model that can classify whether a specific water sample is safe or unfit for consumption.

For the water quality analysis task, I will be using a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. 
All of the factors that affect water quality are very important, so we need to briefly explore each feature of this dataset before training a machine learning model
to predict whether a water sample is safe or unsuitable for consumption. You can download the dataset Iâ€™m using for the water quality analysis task from my git hub profile.


**Summary**
So this is how you can analyze the quality of water and train a machine learning model to classify safe and unsafe water for drinking. 
Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights.
Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning. I hope you liked this article on Water Quality Analysis with Machine Learning using Python.
